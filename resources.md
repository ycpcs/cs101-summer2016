This page contains links to useful resources.

**Windows**

> [Installing Cygwin](installCygwin.html) - detailed instructions on how to install the Cygwin software needed to compile, run, and submit programs.
>
> [Installing Notepad++](installNotepadpp.html) - detailed instructions on how to install the Notepad++ text editor (which we are using in class to edit C/C++ programs).

**Mac**

> Install Xcode by downloading it from the Mac App Store (free). After XCode is installed, open a terminal window and enter **xcode-select --install** (note there are two dashes before **install**) which will install the XCode command line tools. You may use any text editor for editing the source files, e.g. TextEdit, or a nice (free) one is [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) available through the Mac App Store (free).

**Linux**

> Make sure that you have g++, make, curl, and the ncurses development libraries installed. For example, under Ubuntu or Debian Linux, run the command
>
>     sudo apt-get install g++ make curl libncurses5-dev
>
> from a terminal window.
>
> You can use any text editor to edit your code: for example, gedit and kate are both good choices (and are similar to Notepad++). Under Ubuntu, Debian, or Linux Mint:
>
>     sudo apt-get install gedit
>     sudo apt-get install kate
