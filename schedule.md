This schedule is subject to change.  Any change will be announced in class and on the course web page.

Note: The CloudCoder exercises marked with a gold star (![gold star](img/goldstar-tiny.png)) are *challenge problems*.  They are harder than the normal CloudCoder exercises; completing them demonstrates significant mastery of the course topics.  You should definitely try and complete these!
